Dear Workshop Organizers,

We apologize for the delay in creating the proceedings for the workshops and tutorials. In order to speed the process of publication on CEUR, 
we have created a repository on Github to collect all the information and files from the authors, available at: https://github.com/rsouza/LDK2021Workshops 

Basically, each workshop/tutorial organizing committee would have to:

1 - Fork the repository;
2 - Add the PDFs of the papers to the respective folder;
3 - Edit the main HTML file in the root folder to reflect the papers' metadata and update the links to the PDFs;
4 - Collect the signed authorization for publication from all the authors;
5 - Add the authorization file to the same workshop folder;
6 - Write an introduction/a preface concerning the event;
7 - Create a pull request with all the files added to the original repo.

We are keen to help anyone not experienced with Github "forks" and "pull requests". In this case, it is enough to send us the edited version of the HTML file with the PDFs from the authors' papers, as well as the authorizations. The CEUR paper templates and the authorization document are available in the repository.
As regards the internal structure of the volume, we thought that organizing the workshops/tutorials in alphabetical order with their respective papers would be preferable, but it will ultimately depend on the overall number of papers received per event.
We are working to publish as soon as possible, so we kindly ask you to add the necessary files by October 31.
Please contact us if you have any questions.

Thanks and all the best,
Sara and Renato
