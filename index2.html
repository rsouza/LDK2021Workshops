# Instructions for Table of Contents 
# The table of contents normally is a plain list of papers (with titles/authors).
# The paper title should be linked to the paper URL (usually pdf).
# You may include "session" subsections e.g. to reflect the track structure of your workshop.
# Authors should be specified as comma-separated lists with full author names
# (like John Smith). Avoid glue words like 'by' and 'and'. If applicable, then lookup how
# the author is spelled out by DBLP.
# You may also provide additional material such as preface, bibtex files, complete 
# proceedings as a single pdf, and similar items. The additional items should be 
# clearly separated from the paper list, preferably after the table of contents.
# Please only tag original papers with the CEURTITLE/CEURAUTHOR scheme. Rather do not tag
# additional material with this scheme!
# For the time being, presentation slides should also not be tagged by CEURTITLE/CEURAUTHOR.
#
# CEUR-WS shall watermark PDF files in a published volume by its online CEUR-WS.org URL.
# If there are certain PDF files like frontmatter or images that you like to exclude
# from watermarking, then give it a name like 'xfrontmatter.pdf'. 
#
# For all other PDF files, use functional names like
#   - paper1.pdf   (regular papers; start with paper1, then paper2,...)
#   - invited1.pdf  (invited paper)
#   - keynote1.pdf  (a variant for invited papers)
#   - short1.pdf   (a short paper that still is a citable paper)
#   - abstract1.pdf  (an abstract that is not supposed to be a citable paper)
#   - preface.pdf   (a preface, usually not citable)
# By default, all PDF files of a published volume will be watermarked by their online CEUR-WS URL.
# You can disable this by prefixing the filename with the letter 'x', see xpreface below.

  This volume includes the proceedings of the workshops and tutorials co-located with the 3rd Conference on Language,
  Data and Knowledge (LDK 2021), held in Zaragoza, Spain, from September 1-4, 2021. Language, Data and Knowledge is a
  biennial conference series on matters of human language technology, data science, and knowledge representation, with
  its 3rd edition hosted by the University of Zaragoza. Major support was also provided by the NexusLinguarum COST
  Action CA18209 “European network for Web-centred linguistic data science”, as well as by the Prêt-à-LLOD project
  funded by the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 825182.
  Building on current research topics related to the acquisition, representation, curation, and use of language data
  within data science- and knowledge-based approaches, these workshops and tutorials not only presented application
  scenarios involving semantic technologies, NLP and machine learning, but also focused on use cases in humanities,
  in social sciences, and in the biomedical domain, among others.

  Overall, 4 workshops and 2 tutorials were accepted, and all the full text from the tutorials were included in this joint 
  volume, along with those pertaining to the SALLD-1 and MDK21 workshops.

  Workshops:
<ul>
  <li id="ai4hi">AI4HI-2021: 2nd International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Historical 
    Image and Visual Cultural Artefacts Enrichment</li>
  <li id="mdk21">MDK21: 1st International Workshop on Multisensory Data &amp; Knowledge</li>
  <li id="salld-1">SALLD-1: 1st Workshop on Sentiment Analysis and Linguistic Linked Data</li>
  <li id="tiad2021">TIAD 2021: 4th shared task for Translation Inference Across Dictionaries</li>
</ul>

  Tutorials:
<ul>
  <li id="dbpedia">DBpedia Tutorial at LDK 2021</li>
  <li id="lila">LiLa LDK 2021 Tutorial</li>
</ul>

  There were <span class="CEURSUBMITTEDPAPERS">21</span> papers submitted for peer-review to these workshops. Out of these, 
<span class="CEURACCEPTEDPAPERS">21</span> papers were accepted for this volume, 
<span class="CEURACCEPTEDREGULARPAPERS">19</span> as regular papers and
<span class="CEURACCEPTEDSHORTPAPERS">2</span> as short papers.

 We would like to thank all authors, participants and workshop/tutorial organizers for their contributions and support to
 this edition. We sincerely hope that these events continue to provide interdisciplinary settings for academics and industry 
 experts from different backgrounds, such as linguistics, computer science, machine learning, and information science, 
 thereby fostering open discussion and cross-disciplinary collaborations.
